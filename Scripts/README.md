# Assets/Scripts

Be sure to add commneted header to each scripts you create!

You can copy the template for commented header from here;

```
/*
 * Name_Of_Script.cs
 * 
 * Created By: John Doe
 * Created On: 2017 Oct 07
 * Last Edited By: Jane Doe
 * Last Edited On: 2017 Oct 08
 *
 * Short description of this script (Optional) 
 */
```

* When requesting pull(merge), if a script is missing header and comment(s), it will be denied.
* Each and every script will have its header, to indicate who changed what.
* Change made by other than original creator must include their initial in the comment line.
* It is mendatory to create [AddComponentMenu("GDC/Scripts/Script_Name.cs")] for each script for easy searching.
